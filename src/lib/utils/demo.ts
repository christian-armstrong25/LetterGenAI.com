I created an admission dashboard that provided valuable insights and enhanced the user experience. This experience allowed me to sharpen my skills in data visualization and work collaboratively with a team.<br /><br />My coursework in Data Science at Brown University has provided me with a strong foundation in relevant technologies and techniques, including Python, SQL, beautifulsoup, numpy, and scikit learn. I have worked extensively with NLP, web scraping, databases, data cleaning, clustering techniques, regression, and machine learning. These skills have equipped me with the ability to assemble and analyze large, complex data sets to derive actionable insights.<br /><br />Beyond my technical qualifications, I bring strong analytical, quantitative, and problem-solving skills to the table. I thrive in fast-paced environments and possess excellent communication skills, enabling me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. My attention to detail and passion for data-driven decision-making align perfectly with the goals of the Data Science and Engineering team at Malwarebytes.<br /><br />I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to Malwarebytes' ongoing success and would be grateful for the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences can directly benefit the company.
